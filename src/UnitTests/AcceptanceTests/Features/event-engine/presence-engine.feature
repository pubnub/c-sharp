Feature: Presence Event Engine
  Validating the correctness of EE for Presence events

  Background:
    Given the demo keyset with Presence EE enabled

  @contract=presenceTestMultipleWait
  Scenario: Successfully joined a few channels
    Given heartbeatInterval set to '1', timeout set to '60' and suppressLeaveEvents set to 'false'
    When I join 'first', 'second', 'third' channels
    Then I wait '3' seconds
    And I observe the following Events and Invocations of the Presence EE:
      | type       | name              |
      | event      | JOINED            |
      | invocation | HEARTBEAT         |
      | event      | HEARTBEAT_SUCCESS |
      | invocation | WAIT              |
      | event      | TIMES_UP          |
      | invocation | CANCEL_WAIT       |
      | invocation | HEARTBEAT         |
      | event      | HEARTBEAT_SUCCESS |
      | invocation | WAIT              |
      | event      | TIMES_UP          |
      | invocation | CANCEL_WAIT       |
      | invocation | HEARTBEAT         |

  @contract=presenceJoin
  Scenario: Successfully joined a few channels with presence
    Given heartbeatInterval set to '1', timeout set to '60' and suppressLeaveEvents set to 'false'
    When I join 'first', 'second', 'third' channels with presence
    Then I wait for getting Presence joined events
    And I observe the following Events and Invocations of the Presence EE:
      | type       | name              |
      | event      | JOINED            |
      | invocation | HEARTBEAT         |
      | event      | HEARTBEAT_SUCCESS |
      | invocation | WAIT              |

  @contract=presenceJoinWithAnError
  Scenario: Recovery from one unexpected error along the way
    Given heartbeatInterval set to '1', timeout set to '60' and suppressLeaveEvents set to 'false'
    Given a linear reconnection policy with 3 retries
    When I join 'first', 'second', 'third' channels with presence
    Then I wait for getting Presence joined events
    And I observe the following Events and Invocations of the Presence EE:
      | type       | name                     |
      | event      | JOINED                   |
      | invocation | HEARTBEAT                |
      | event      | HEARTBEAT_FAILURE        |
      | invocation | DELAYED_HEARTBEAT        |
      | event      | HEARTBEAT_SUCCESS        |
      | invocation | CANCEL_DELAYED_HEARTBEAT |
      | invocation | WAIT                     |

  @contract=presenceJoinWithContinuousFailures
  Scenario: Complete handshake failure
    Given heartbeatInterval set to '1', timeout set to '60' and suppressLeaveEvents set to 'false'
    Given a linear reconnection policy with 3 retries
    When I join 'first', 'second', 'third' channels
    Then I receive an error in my heartbeat response
    And I observe the following Events and Invocations of the Presence EE:
      | type       | name                     |
      | event      | JOINED                   |
      | invocation | HEARTBEAT                |
      | event      | HEARTBEAT_FAILURE        |
      | invocation | DELAYED_HEARTBEAT        |
      | event      | HEARTBEAT_FAILURE        |
      | invocation | CANCEL_DELAYED_HEARTBEAT |
      | invocation | DELAYED_HEARTBEAT        |
      | event      | HEARTBEAT_FAILURE        |
      | invocation | CANCEL_DELAYED_HEARTBEAT |
      | invocation | DELAYED_HEARTBEAT        |
      | event      | HEARTBEAT_FAILURE        |
      | invocation | CANCEL_DELAYED_HEARTBEAT |
      | invocation | DELAYED_HEARTBEAT        |
      | event      | HEARTBEAT_GIVEUP         |
      | invocation | CANCEL_DELAYED_HEARTBEAT |

  @contract=presenceLeave
  Scenario: Joining and leaving channels
    Given heartbeatInterval set to '20', timeout set to '60' and suppressLeaveEvents set to 'false'
    When I join 'first', 'second', 'third' channels with presence
    Then I wait for getting Presence joined events
    Then I leave 'first' and 'second' channels with presence
    Then I wait '3' seconds
    And I observe the following Events and Invocations of the Presence EE:
      | type       | name              |
      | event      | JOINED            |
      | invocation | HEARTBEAT         |
      | event      | HEARTBEAT_SUCCESS |
      | invocation | WAIT              |
      | event      | LEFT              |

      | invocation | HEARTBEAT         |
      | event      | HEARTBEAT_SUCCESS |
      | invocation | WAIT              |

  @contract=presenceJoinWithHeartbeatDisabled
  Scenario: Joining a few channels with heartbeat interval set to 0
    Given heartbeatInterval set to '0', timeout set to '60' and suppressLeaveEvents set to 'false'
    When I join 'first', 'second', 'third' channels
    Then I don't observe any Events and Invocations of the Presence EE
